= filter-action-based-task-assignation

The project **filter-action-based-task-assignation** is a Bonita actor filter designed for the **Bonita {short-bonita-version}** version, specifically to be used with the **ProcessBuilder** project. It is written in `java`.

This actor filter's purpose is to dynamically assign task candidates based on the actions or roles defined within the process. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of task assignments in human tasks by linking them to specific, actionable business logic.

== Features

This filter provides a robust and flexible way to manage task assignment:

  * **Action-Based Assignment**: Dynamically filters and assigns task candidates based on business actions, rather than static roles.
  * **Role-based Filtering**: Restricts candidates to users who have a specific role or are part of a particular group.
  * **Integration with Business Logic**: Allows task assignment to be directly driven by the data and logic of your process.

== Getting started

To get started, you'll need to create your project from the Bonita actor filter archetype and then customize the filter logic to meet your specific needs.

For detailed information on how to create a custom actor filter, please refer to the {doc-url}/process/actor-filter-archetype[Bonita documentation, window = "\_blank"].

== Developing

Here's a brief introduction on how to get started with this project.

Prerequisites:

  - Java (**jdk {java-version}** or higher)
  - Maven (optional, but highly recommended)
  - A Git client

=== Building

To build the project after making code changes, follow these steps:

## [source,bash]

## git clone https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/your-username/filter-action-based-task-assignation.git 
## cd filter-action-based-task-assignation/ mvnw package

The build will produce a JAR file named `filter-action-based-task-assignation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target/` folder.

This command compiles the source code, runs tests, and packages the filter into a distributable JAR file, ensuring all dependencies are included.

For more details about Apache Maven, please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[documentation].

=== Deploying / Publishing

Once built, you can install the filter in your Bonita project.
