= Action Based Task Assignation Filter

The project **filter-action-based-task-assignation** is a Bonita actor filter designed for the **Bonita {short-bonita-version} ({short-bonita-tech-version})**  version, specifically to be used with the **ProcessBuilder** project. It is written in `java`.

This actor filter's purpose is to dynamically assign task candidates based on the actions or roles defined within the process. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of task assignments in human tasks by linking them to specific, actionable business logic.

== Features

This filter provides a robust and flexible way to manage task assignment:

  * **Action-Based Assignment**: Dynamically filters and assigns task candidates based on business actions, rather than static roles.
  * **Role-based Filtering**: Restricts candidates to users who have a specific role or are part of a particular group.
  * **Integration with Business Logic**: Allows task assignment to be directly driven by the data and logic of your process.

== Getting started

To get started, you'll need to create your project from the Bonita actor filter archetype and then customize the filter logic to meet your specific needs.

For detailed information on how to create a custom actor filter, please refer to the {doc-url}/process/actor-filter-archetype[Bonita documentation, window = "\_blank"].

== Developing

To start developing this project, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Java ( **jdk {java-version}** or higher): This project is built with Java, so you'll need the Java Development Kit.
- Maven (optional if you choosed to use https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper script] as archetype option): To manage dependencies and the project lifecycle. While the included Maven Wrapper (./mvnw) is sufficient, having Maven installed globally can be helpful.
- A Git client: To clone the repository and contribute your changes.

Once you have everything set up, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory to start working.

=== Building

To build the project in your local environment, follow these steps. This is useful for development and testing before publishing.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/filter-action-based-task-assignment.git
cd filter-action-based-task-assignment/
./mvnw clean package
```

Once the command is executed, the `filter-action-based-task-assignment-1.0.jar` artifact is created inside the `target/` directory. This process compiles the code, runs tests, and packages the filter into a `.jar` file.

For more details about Apache Maven, you can refer to its [documentation](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/).

=== Deploying and Publishing

To deploy and publish this project, we've automated the process using GitHub Actions. This means you **don't need to manually compile it** for publication.

The CI/CD workflow automatically handles compiling and testing the project every time changes are pushed to a branch.

To publish the filter and make it available for the presales team, simply follow these two steps:

1.  **Create a tag**: Add a tag to the `master` branch (for example, `v1.0.0`).
2.  **Create a release**: In GitHub, go to the releases section and create a new release from the tag you just created.

This will trigger a GitHub Action that compiles the project, generates the final artifact, and attaches it to the release.

If you need to test the `.jar` locally, you can manually install it in your Bonita Studio project. To do this, please refer to the [Bonita documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://documentation.bonitasoft.com/bonita/latest/managing-extension-studio).

== Documentation

This project uses Maven to generate its documentation. You can build the documentation site locally with the following command:
```bash
./mvnw clean verify site
```
After running the command, you can access the generated documentation and reports in the target/site directory.

=== Javadoc Documentation

The Javadoc documentation for the project's source code is located in:

target/site/apidocs/index.html

Here, you can find the detailed API documentation, including method descriptions, parameters, and return values for all classes.

=== Code Coverage Report

The JaCoCo code coverage report is located in:

target/site/jacoco/index.html

This report provides a detailed view of your test coverage, highlighting which lines of code are executed by your unit tests and which are not.

=== Activating Documentation on GitHub Pages
To view your Javadoc documentation and JaCoCo reports online, you must activate GitHub Pages for your repository. The GitHub Actions workflow will handle the deployment automatically, but the initial configuration needs to be done only once.

Follow these steps to enable GitHub Pages:

* In your GitHub repository, navigate to Settings.
* In the left-hand menu, click on Pages.
* In the "Build and deployment" section, select GitHub Actions from the "Source" dropdown menu.
* Click Save.

Once your CI/CD workflow has run successfully, your documentation will be available at the GitHub Pages URL assigned to your repository.


== Contributing

To facilitate collaboration, we want to ensure all code is clean and adheres to our standards. We will use a dedicated branch for all development, following the principles of Clean Code and the Git Flow workflow.

Clean Code refers to writing code that is readable, maintainable, and easy to understand. Git Flow is a Git branching strategy that organizes development, features, and releases in a structured manner.

To begin contributing, create a branch from master and name it using the ID of the Jira ticket or user story.

```bash
# Create and switch to your new branch
git checkout -b <jira-ticket-id>_<short-description> master
If the develop branch does not already exist, create it from master and push it to the repository.
```

```bash
git checkout -b develop master
git push origin develop
``` 

Once your work is complete, submit a pull request to the develop branch. Please ensure your code follows our established conventions and that all tests pass.

== Links

_**TODO**_: Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:
=== Links

  * **Project homepage**: https://github.com/bonitasoft-presales/filter-action-based-task-assignation
  * **Repository**: https://github.com/bonitasoft-presales/filter-action-based-task-assignation.git
  * **Issue tracker**: https://github.com/bonitasoft-presales/filter-action-based-task-assignation/issues


To build the project in your local environment (useful for development and testing), follow these steps:
