= filter-action-based-task-assignment

The project **filter-action-based-task-assignation** is a Bonita actor filter designed for the **Bonita {short-bonita-version} ({short-bonita-tech-version})**  version, specifically to be used with the **ProcessBuilder** project. It is written in `java`.

This actor filter's purpose is to dynamically assign task candidates based on the actions or roles defined within the process. It enhances the flexibility and efficiency of task assignments in human tasks by linking them to specific, actionable business logic.


== Features

This filter provides a robust and flexible way to manage task assignment:

  * **Action-Based Assignment**: Dynamically filters and assigns task candidates based on business actions, rather than static roles.
  * **Role-based Filtering**: Restricts candidates to users who have a specific role or are part of a particular group.
  * **Integration with Business Logic**: Allows task assignment to be directly driven by the data and logic of your process.

== Getting started

To get started, you'll need to create your project from the Bonita actor filter archetype and then customize the filter logic to meet your specific needs.

For detailed information on how to create a custom actor filter, please refer to the {doc-url}/process/actor-filter-archetype[Bonita documentation, window = "\_blank"].

== Developing

Here's a brief introduction on how to get started with this project.

Prerequisites:

  - Java (**jdk {java-version}** or higher)
  - Maven (optional, but highly recommended)
  - A Git client

=== Building

To build the project after making code changes, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/filter-action-based-task-assignation.git
cd filter-action-based-task-assignation/
./mvnw package
```

The build will produce a JAR file named `filter-action-based-task-assignation-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target/` folder.

This command compiles the source code, runs tests, and packages the filter into a distributable JAR file, ensuring all dependencies are included.

For more details about Apache Maven, please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[documentation].

=== Deploying / Publishing

Once built, you can install the filter in your Bonita project.

== Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community\! If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature branch. Pull requests are always welcome.

If there is anything else you need to know, please refer to our `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` file.

== Features

_**TODO**_: What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?

* What's the main functionality
* You can also do another thing
* If you get really handy, you can even do this

== Getting started

_**TODO**_: A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.
For more details on Bonita Actor Fitler please refer to {doc-url}/actor-filter-archetype[documentation]

== Developing
_**TODO**_: Here's a brief introduction about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Prerequisite:

- Java ( **jdk {java-version}** or higher)
- Maven (optional if you choosed to use https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper script] as archetype option)
- A Git client (optional but highly recommended)

=== Building

_**TODO**_: If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://your.github.com/filter-action-based-task-assignment.git
cd filter-action-based-task-assignment/
./mwnw package
----

The build should produce a jar archive under the `target/` folder named `filter-action-based-task-assignment-1.0.jar`

_**TODO**_: Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

For more details about Apache Maven, please refer to the https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/[documentation]

=== Deploying / Publishing

_**TODO**_: In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a server, this is the right time to state it.

{doc-url}/managing-extension-studio[Install the actor filter in your Bonita project using the Studio, window = "_blank"].

== Contributing

_**TODO**_: Make easy to your team to jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.adoc` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.

== Links

_**TODO**_: Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:
